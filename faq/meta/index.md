### What is Awesome Flipper Zero?
> It's an [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) that I ([djsime1](https://dj.je)) created shortly after receiving Lurat, my lovely dolphin sidekick.

### What is an Awesome List?
> An [Awesome List](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md) is a collection of links and resources related to some project or topic. Think of it like a central curated hub to discover interesting stuff.


### How can I contribute to this repo?
> Perferably, open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with your changes, or use one of the methods in the next question to contact me.

### I found a mistake, broken link, or something else. What should I do?
> Open a [new discussion](https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero/discussions/new) on this repo, or contact me via one of the methods listed on [this page](https://dj.je/pages/contact).

### Why are there so many unmerged pull requests?
> If there's multiple small pull requests open at the same time, I'll often merge them together as a single update. Due to the way GitHub works, I'm unable to mark them as merged when I do this. To compensate, I include the contributors as co-authors on the commit, and mention the Pull Request ID's as part of the update message.

### This is really cool! Is there a way I can donate to you?
> I really appreciate the kind words, however I'm not accepting personal monetary donations.
> If you're really insistent, I'll accept a Discord Nitro gift ([`@DJ#9822`](https://discord.gg/9rduBhctJ6)) or Steam Game ([`/id/djsime1`](https://steamcommunity.com/id/djsime1/))!
> Besides that, why not support a local charity/organization instead? My personal recommendation is the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://supporters.eff.org/donate).
